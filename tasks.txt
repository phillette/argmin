Data Cleaning / Prep:
* Generate vocab dictionary
* Determine missing word vectors
* Train missing word vectors
* Place embedding matrix at the front of the network and tune as part of training
* Get the no_gold_label RandomGenerator working (currently a memory error)
* Compare the speeds of my various generators and find the right one

Training Process:
* Create separate checkpoint files based on config settings automatically
* Save histories of loss / accuracy
* Add an option to look at accuracy on dev / train after each epoch and record that history
