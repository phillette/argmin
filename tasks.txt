Data Cleaning / Prep:
* Generate vocab dictionary
* Determine missing word vectors
* Train missing word vectors
* Place embedding matrix at the front of the network and tune as part of training

Training Process:
* Create separate checkpoint files based on config settings automatically
* Add an option to look at accuracy on dev / train after each epoch and record that history
* As Parikh et al do, look at (prepending?) a NULL token to each sentence
    - Do this as a controlled experiment and note the difference in performance

Models:
* Look at an increased capacity
