"""
Look again at papers that report results on this data set for baselines
and how to do train-test split, etc.

For my purposes, I may need to process it into sentence pairs with labels.
That may involve creating a bunch of "None" pairs that aren't in the json.

Nice to see the "concatenated" file with all the pure text.
It could be used for word vector training potentially.
But I would want to remove the urls it would seem.
